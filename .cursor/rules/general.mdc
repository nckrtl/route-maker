This project is Laravel 12 package. The code base is forked from the Spatie package skeleton.

## Technologies
- Testing: Pest. Tests should be run with `composer test`
- Static analyisis: Larastan. Static analysis can be run with `composer analyse`


For testing we use Pest not PHPUnit
- When a new feature is requested always write a Pest test for it.
- Whenever you're asked to fixed an error due to tests, always run tests again to verify your solution is working.
